/**
 * Recommendation→Action Loop (Phase 1). A `recommendations` ledger — a first-class
 * record of substantive recommendations Robin makes, modeled on the `predictions`
 * lifecycle (migration 004). It closes the loop the motivating TC-1.4× case exposed:
 * Robin recommended it, Kevin bought it the next day, and nothing linked the two.
 *
 * Design ref: docs/design/2026-06-17-recommendation-loop-design.md §3.
 *
 * Notable columns:
 *  - `subject` is the linker's MATCH KEY — the short canonical name of the recommended
 *    thing ("Nikon Z TC-1.4x"). The nightly `recommendation-link.run` job resolves an
 *    open recommendation when a behavioral signal's `object` canonically matches it.
 *  - `source_event_id` FK → events(id) `ON DELETE SET NULL` — where the rec was made;
 *    survives event purges by nulling rather than orphaning.
 *  - `action_event_id` FK → events(id) `ON DELETE SET NULL` — the behavioral
 *    signal/event that fulfilled it (a purchase, a decision); same purge-safety.
 *  - `evidence` is a TEXT audit of HOW the link was established; like the habits
 *    `evidence_summary`, it is the durable trail that survives the source-event purge.
