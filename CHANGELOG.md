# Changelog

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-27

### Breaking changes
- Distribution model changed from npm package (`npx robin-assistant init`) to git-clone. The repo IS the workspace. See README for new onboarding.
- Layout: system files now under `core/`; personal data under `user-data/` (gitignored).
- Protocols renamed to operations: `core/protocols/` → `core/operations/`.
- `AGENTS.md` moved to repo root (per the AGENTS.md community spec).
- `robin` CLI binary retired. Functionality exposed as `npm run <command>`: `backup`, `restore`, `reset`, `install-hooks`, `migrate`, `migrate-v3`.
- `export` renamed to `backup`; `rollback` renamed to `restore` (now restores user-data from a backup tar.gz, not system files from an update backup).
- `init` removed — `git clone` replaces it.
- `update` removed — `git pull` is the update verb.
- `Rule: Remote Exposure Guard` removed (remotes are now expected); replaced by gitignore + Node-based pre-commit hook.
- `commander` runtime dependency dropped — repo has zero runtime deps.

### New
- Migration framework at `core/migrations/`. Drop a versioned migration file; it auto-applies on session start with a pre-migration backup.
- Customization extension points: `user-data/custom-rules.md`, `user-data/operations/` (overlays `core/operations/`).
- `artifacts/` directory: `artifacts/input/` for user-supplied files (not auto-read), `artifacts/output/` for AI-generated artifacts.
- Auto-applied additive config schema migrations on session start (`lib/config-migrate.js`).
- Generated root pointer files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`) from `core/scripts/lib/platforms.js`.
- Auto-generated `core/operations/INDEX.md` from per-operation YAML frontmatter.
- CHANGELOG-aware session-start notification (`lib/changelog-notify.js`).
- Native Antigravity support (reads root `AGENTS.md`).

### Migration from v2
Run `npm run migrate-v3 -- --from <path-to-v2-workspace>` from a fresh v3 clone. Source workspace is left untouched. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-27-distribution-redesign-design.md` for full migration semantics.

## 2.1.0 — Memory Indexing & Metadata Layer

### Added
- Per-file sidecar indexes at `index/*.idx.md` with entry-level metadata (domains, tags, relationships, summaries)
- Root manifest at `manifest.md` providing file-level memory overview
- Timestamp-based entry IDs embedded in source files (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<session><seq>`)
- `robin migrate-index` command for upgrading v2.0.0 workspaces (Phase A: structural)
- Phase B semantic enrichment runs in background on first post-migration session
- Dream Phase 0 (index integrity) and Phase 4 (index maintenance)
- Index write step in capture rules — entries are indexed at capture time
- Controlled domain vocabulary: work, personal, finance, health, learning, home, shopping, travel
- Tag normalization rules (lowercase, hyphen-separated)
- Cross-reference syntax for linking entries across files
- Validation checks for index integrity on v2.1.0 workspaces

### Changed
- Config version bumped to 2.1.0 with `indexing` status field
- Startup sequence includes Phase B check and manifest reading
- Dream protocol expanded with Phase 0, Phase 4, and entry movement indexing
- Capture rules include index write step and trip indexing

## 1.0.0 (Unreleased)

Initial release.

- CLI with 9 commands: init, configure, update, check-update, rollback, validate, version, export, reset
- Core operational files: 12 protocols, coordination scripts, self-improvement framework, privacy scan
- Dream protocol for automatic memory consolidation
- Passive knowledge capture system
- Override system for user customizations
- Multi-session coordination with atomic locks
- Auto-update check with user approval
- Pre-push git hook for privacy protection
- `trips/` directory scaffolded on init with `_template.md` showing per-trip structure (was referenced in `AGENTS.md` but not created)
